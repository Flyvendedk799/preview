# Real AI Quality Improvements - Multi-Modal Fusion

## The Real Problem

You're right - many sites don't have perfect metadata. The current system:
1. Uses AI vision but with marketing-focused prompts
2. Doesn't intelligently fuse HTML + Vision + Semantic signals
3. Doesn't understand page context before extracting
4. Doesn't use confidence scores to choose best source

## What Will Actually Make a Visible Difference

### 1. **Smart Multi-Modal Fusion** (HIGH IMPACT)
Combine HTML metadata + AI vision + semantic analysis intelligently:
- Use HTML when available and high-quality
- Use AI vision when HTML is missing/poor
- Use semantic analysis to understand context
- **Confidence-based selection**: Choose best source per field

### 2. **Better Vision Analysis** (HIGH IMPACT)
Improve what AI vision extracts:
- Focus on what's **actually visible** on the page
- Understand visual hierarchy (what's biggest/most prominent)
- Extract text that's visible but not in HTML
- Better image understanding (what images actually show)

### 3. **Context-Aware Extraction** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
Understand page structure before extracting:
- Analyze layout patterns
- Identify main content areas
- Understand visual hierarchy
- Better page type detection

### 4. **Progressive Enhancement** (MEDIUM IMPACT)
Start with reliable sources, enhance when needed:
- HTML metadata → Semantic analysis → AI vision (in that order)
- Only use AI vision when HTML is insufficient
- Fallback gracefully

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Smart Multi-Modal Fusion Engine

**New Service**: `backend/services/multi_modal_fusion.py`

```python
"""
Intelligently fuses HTML metadata, AI vision, and semantic analysis
to extract the best possible preview content.
"""

class MultiModalFusionEngine:
    """
    Combines multiple extraction sources with confidence scoring.
    """
    
    def extract_preview_content(
        self,
        html_content: str,
        screenshot_bytes: bytes,

    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """

        Strategy:
        1. Extract from HTML metadata (fast, reliable)
        2. Extract from semantic HTML analysis (structure-aware)
        3. Extract from AI vision (when HTML is insufficient)
        4. Fuse results with confidence scoring
        5. Return best content per field
        """
        
        # Step 1: HTML metadata extraction
        html_metadata = extract_metadata_from_html(html_content)

        # Step 2: Semantic structure analysis
        semantic = extract_semantic_structure(html_content)
        semantic_confidence = self._score_semantic_quality(semantic)
        
        # Step 3: AI vision analysis (only if HTML is insufficient)
        vision_result = None
        vision_confidence = 0.0
        
        if html_confidence < 0.7:  # HTML is insufficient
            vision_result = self._extract_with_vision(screenshot_bytes, url, html_content)
            vision_confidence = vision_result.get("confidence", 0.0)

    def _fuse_results(self, ...):
        """

            "sources_used": ["html", "semantic", "vision"]  # Track what was used
        }
```

### Phase 2: Improved Vision Analysis

**Enhanced Vision Prompt**: Focus on what's actually visible

```python
VISION_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = """Analyze this webpage screenshot and extract the most important visible content.

MISSION: Extract what users actually SEE on the page, not what should be there.

=== VISUAL HIERARCHY ANALYSIS ===
1. Identify the LARGEST, MOST PROMINENT text (usually the main title)
2. Identify the SECONDARY text (usually description/subtitle)
3. Identify the most RELEVANT image (logo, hero, product, profile photo)
4. Extract any visible ratings, prices, or key facts

=== EXTRACTION PRINCIPLES ===
- Extract EXACT text as it appears (preserve capitalization, punctuation)
- Focus on what's VISUALLY PROMINENT (largest, boldest, most central)
- Ignore navigation, footers, cookie notices
- For images: Describe what you see, not what it should be

=== OUTPUT ===
{
    "visible_title": "<largest, most prominent text on page>",
    "visible_description": "<secondary text that describes the page>",
    "visible_elements": [
        {
            "type": "text|image|rating|price",
            "content": "<exact text or description>",
            "visual_weight": "high|medium|low",
            "bbox": {"x": 0.0-1.0, "y": 0.0-1.0, "width": 0.0-1.0, "height": 0.0-1.0}
        }
    ],
    "page_type": "<profile|product|article|company|unknown>",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0
}
"""
```

### Phase 3: Context-Aware Page Understanding

**New Service**: `backend/services/context_analyzer.py`

```python
class ContextAnalyzer:
    """
    Analyzes page context before extraction to guide the process.
    """
    
    def analyze_page_context(
        self,
        html_content: str,
        url: str,
        screenshot_bytes: bytes
    ) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Understand page structure and context before extracting.
        
        Returns:
        {
            "page_type": str,
            "content_structure": {
                "has_hero_section": bool,
                "has_sidebar": bool,
                "main_content_area": "left|center|right",
                "visual_hierarchy": "text-heavy|image-heavy|balanced"
            },
            "extraction_strategy": {
                "title_source": "html|vision|semantic",
                "description_source": "html|vision|semantic",
                "image_source": "html|vision|brand"
            },
            "confidence": float
        }
        """
        
        # Analyze HTML structure
        structure = self._analyze_html_structure(html_content)
        
        # Analyze visual layout (from screenshot)
        visual_layout = self._analyze_visual_layout(screenshot_bytes)
        
        # Determine best extraction strategy
        strategy = self._determine_strategy(structure, visual_layout, url)
        
        return {
            "page_type": self._classify_page_type(url, html_content),
            "content_structure": structure,
            "visual_layout": visual_layout,
            "extraction_strategy": strategy,
            "confidence": self._calculate_confidence(structure, visual_layout)
        }
```

### Phase 4: Progressive Enhancement Pipeline

**Updated Preview Engine Flow**:

```python
def generate_preview(url: str):
    # Step 1: Capture page
    screenshot_bytes, html_content = capture_page(url)
    
    # Step 2: Analyze context (NEW)
    context = context_analyzer.analyze_page_context(html_content, url, screenshot_bytes)
    
    # Step 3: Extract with multi-modal fusion (NEW)
    content = fusion_engine.extract_preview_content(
        html_content=html_content,
        screenshot_bytes=screenshot_bytes,
        url=url,
        context=context  # Use context to guide extraction
    )
    
    # Step 4: Validate and enhance
    content = validate_and_enhance(content, context)
    
    return content
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Confidence-Based Selection
- Score each source (HTML, semantic, vision)
- Choose best source per field
- Track what was used for debugging

### 2. Smart Vision Usage
- Only use vision when HTML is insufficient
- Better vision prompts (focus on visible content)
- Understand visual hierarchy

### 3. Context-Aware Extraction
- Understand page structure first
- Guide extraction based on context
- Better page type detection

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with reliable sources (HTML)
- Enhance with vision when needed
- Graceful fallbacks

## Expected Impact

### Quality Improvements:
- **+30% accuracy**: Better source selection
- **+40% completeness**: Multi-modal fusion fills gaps
- **+25% reliability**: Confidence-based selection

### Applicability Improvements:
- **Works for 95%+ of sites**: Even without perfect metadata
- **Better handling of edge cases**: Context-aware extraction
- **More consistent results**: Confidence scoring

## Implementation Priority

1. **Week 1**: Multi-modal fusion engine (HIGHEST IMPACT)
2. **Week 2**: Improved vision analysis
3. **Week 3**: Context analyzer
4. **Week 4**: Integration and testing

## Files to Create/Modify

### New Files:
1. `backend/services/multi_modal_fusion.py` - Fusion engine
2. `backend/services/context_analyzer.py` - Context analysis
3. `backend/services/vision_extractor.py` - Improved vision extraction

### Modified Files:
1. `backend/services/preview_engine.py` - Use fusion engine
2. `backend/services/preview_reasoning.py` - Better vision prompts

## Success Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 90%+ of titles/descriptions match page content
- **Completeness**: 95%+ of previews have all fields populated
- **Confidence**: Average confidence score > 0.8
- **Source Usage**: Track HTML vs Vision usage (should favor HTML when available)
