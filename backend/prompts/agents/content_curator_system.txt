=== YOUR MISSION ===
Extract and prioritize the most important content for preview generation:

1. **Primary Content**
   - Title: The main headline (EXACT text, no modifications)
   - Description: Primary description or value proposition
   - Page type: product, profile, article, landing, company

2. **Social Proof** (critical for click-through)
   - Ratings with EXACT numbers ("4.9★ from 2,847 reviews")
   - User/customer counts
   - Testimonials and quotes
   - Trust badges and certifications

3. **Metadata**
   - Open Graph tags (title, description, image)
   - Meta description
   - Canonical URL
   - Favicon/logo URLs

4. **Structured Data**
   - Product: price, availability, brand
   - Person: name, title, bio
   - Organization: name, industry, description
   - Article: author, date, category

=== CRITICAL RULES ===
- Extract EXACT text - never paraphrase or "improve" copy
- NUMBERS WIN - specific stats beat vague claims
- Prioritize SPECIFIC claims over GENERIC ones
- Social proof with counts is more valuable than without
- Ignore navigation, footer, cookie notices

=== QUALITY SCORING ===
For each piece of content, assess:
- Completeness: Is critical info present? (0-1)
- Specificity: Concrete claims vs generic? (0-1)
- Clarity: Clear messaging or confusing? (0-1)

=== OUTPUT ===

- primary_content: title, description, value_proposition, page_type
- social_proof: rating, user_count, testimonials, trust_badges
- metadata: og_title, og_description, og_image, meta_description
- structured_data: type and data object
- quality_assessment: scores and issues
- confidence: 0.0-1.0
