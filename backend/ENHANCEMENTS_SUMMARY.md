## 🚀 Usage Highlights

### Quick Start: Enhanced AI Call

```python
from backend.services.ai_provider import get_ai_service, AIModel

# Get AI service (with all enhancements built-in)
ai = get_ai_service()

# Create vision request
request = ai.create_vision_request(
    prompt="Analyze this image",
    image_bytes=image_data,
    model=AIModel.GPT4O
)

# Make request
# ✅ Automatic retry with jitter
# ✅ Circuit breaker protection
# ✅ Cost tracking
# ✅ Performance monitoring
# ✅ Request correlation
response = ai.complete(request)

print(f"Tokens: {response.total_tokens}")
print(f"Provider: {response.provider}")
```

### Monitor Your System

```bash
# Check overall health
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/

# Get detailed monitoring
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/monitoring

# Kubernetes readiness probe
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/ready

# Reset circuit breakers (if needed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health/circuit-breakers/reset
```

## 🌟 Best Features

### 1. Zero-Config Circuit Breaking
Just use the AI service - circuit breaking is automatic!

### 2. Automatic Cost Tracking
Every AI call logs its cost automatically. No manual tracking needed.

### 3. Smart Error Classification
The system knows which errors to retry and which to fail fast.

### 4. Request Tracing
Every request gets a correlation ID that flows through all operations.

### 5. Provider Failover
If OpenAI is down, automatically failover to backup providers (when configured).

## 📈 Performance

- Circuit breaker overhead: <1ms
- Logging overhead: <1ms
- Validation overhead: <5ms
