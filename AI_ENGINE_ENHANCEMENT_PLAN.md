# AI Engine Enhancement Plan
## Fixing Poor Results & Misclassification Issues

**Date**: December 12, 2024  
**Goal**: Dramatically improve AI reasoning accuracy and reduce classification errors  
**Current Issues**: Poor quality results, profile page misclassification  
**Target**: 85%+ accuracy, eliminate false profile classifications

---

## 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Issue #1: Profile Page Misclassification ⚠️

**Problem**: System incorrectly classifies non-profile pages as profiles

**Root Causes**:
1. **Overly aggressive URL patterns**:
   ```python
   # CURRENT (TOO BROAD):
   r'/team/',        # Could be "About Our Team" page (company, not profile)
   r'/about/.*/.*',  # Could be "About Company" not "About Person"
   r'/expert[s]?/',  # Could be "Expert Team" page, not individual
   ```
   
2. **No negative signals**: System only looks for positive matches, never checks what RULES OUT profile
   - Missing check: "Does page have multiple people? → NOT a profile"
   - Missing check: "Is title a company name? → NOT a profile"
   - Missing check: "Are there pricing tables? → NOT a profile"

3. **Weak metadata validation**: HTML metadata gets high confidence (0.85) even when ambiguous

4. **No cross-validation**: AI extracts "name" without verifying it's actually a person name vs company name

**Examples of False Positives**:
- `/team/` → Classified as PROFILE (should be COMPANY)
- `/about/our-experts/` → Classified as PROFILE (should be COMPANY/LANDING)
- Homepage with founder photo → Classified as PROFILE (should be LANDING)

---

### Issue #2: Poor Quality Extraction 📉

**Problem**: Extracted content is generic, irrelevant, or confusing

**Root Causes**:
1. **Overly complex AI prompts** (500+ lines):
   - Too many conflicting instructions
   - AI gets confused about priorities
   - No clear examples of good vs bad

2. **No output validation**:
   - Accepts any text as "hook" even if it's navigation text
   - Doesn't verify social proof has numbers
   - Doesn't check if name looks like an actual name

3. **Missing context**:
   - AI doesn't know what similar pages typically extract
   - No examples of successful extractions
   - No quality threshold enforcement

4. **Weak fallback logic**:
   - Falls back to "Untitled" too easily
   - Doesn't retry with adjusted parameters
   - No quality scoring of extracted content

**Examples of Poor Results**:
- Hook: "Welcome" (should be actual value proposition)
- Name: "Senior Full Stack Developer" (should be person's actual name)
- Social proof: "Great reviews" (should have numbers: "4.9★ from 2,847 reviews")

---

### Issue #3: Inconsistent Quality ⚡

**Problem**: Same URL produces different results on different runs

**Root Causes**:
1. **High temperature** (0.05 is low but still some variance)
2. **No deterministic seed**
3. **No result caching at prompt level**
4. **No quality comparison between attempts**

---

## 🎯 ENHANCEMENT STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Fix Classification System (CRITICAL)

**Goal**: Eliminate false profile classifications, improve accuracy to 90%+

#### 1.1 Add Negative Signals (NEW CONCEPT)

Create signals that **DISPROVE** classifications:

```python
# New function in intelligent_page_classifier.py

def _analyze_negative_signals(self, signals: List[ClassificationSignal]) -> List[ClassificationSignal]:
    """
    Generate negative signals that disprove certain classifications.
    
    Example: If page has pricing table → NOT a profile page
    """
    negative_signals = []
    
    # DISPROVE PROFILE if:
    # - Multiple people shown
    # - Pricing table exists
    # - Company name in title
    # - E-commerce elements
    # - Multiple team members
    
    # DISPROVE PRODUCT if:
    # - No price or "buy" button
    # - Looks like article/blog
    
    return negative_signals
```

**Implementation**:
```python
# Add to classify() method:
# 5. Add negative signals
negative_signals = self._analyze_negative_signals(signals, content_structure)
signals.extend(negative_signals)
```

**Expected Impact**: -80% false profile classifications

---

#### 1.2 Refine Profile Pattern Matching

**Current Problem**:
```python
profile_patterns = [
    r'/team/',     # ❌ TOO BROAD - matches company team pages
    r'/about/',    # ❌ TOO BROAD - matches company about pages
]
```

**Solution** - Add context requirements:
```python
profile_patterns = [
    r'/profile[s]?/[^/]+$',      # /profile/john-doe (has user slug)
    r'/user[s]?/[^/]+$',         # /user/jane-smith (has user slug)
    r'/@[^/]+$',                 # /@username (social media style)
    r'/~[^/]+',                  # /~johndoe (tilde style)
    # Remove: /team/, /about/ - too generic
]

# NEW: Require BOTH pattern match AND individual indicator
def is_likely_profile(url, content):
    has_profile_pattern = any(match for pattern in profile_patterns)
    has_individual_indicator = (
        has_singular_person_name(content) and
        not has_multiple_people(content) and
        not has_company_indicators(content)
    )
    return has_profile_pattern and has_individual_indicator
```

**Expected Impact**: -70% false positives

---

#### 1.3 Multi-Signal Verification

**New Requirement**: Classifications need **2+ independent signals** at medium confidence

```python
def _aggregate_signals_enhanced(self, signals: List[ClassificationSignal]):
    """
    Enhanced aggregation requiring cross-validation.
    
    - Single high-confidence signal (0.8+) = RISKY, require verification
    - Two medium signals (0.6+) from different sources = GOOD
    - Three+ low signals (0.4+) = ACCEPTABLE
    """
    # Group by source
    sources = {}
    for signal in signals:
        if signal.category not in sources:
            sources[signal.category] = {}
        if signal.source not in sources[signal.category]:
            sources[signal.category][signal.source] = []
        sources[signal.category][signal.source].append(signal)
    
    # Require cross-validation
    for category, source_signals in sources.items():
        if len(source_signals) == 1:  # Only ONE source
            # Reduce confidence
            confidence *= 0.7
            logger.warning(f"Single-source classification for {category} - reducing confidence")
```

**Expected Impact**: -50% misclassifications, +30% confidence accuracy

---

### Phase 2: Improve AI Prompts (HIGH IMPACT)

**Goal**: Higher quality extractions, more consistent results

#### 2.1 Simplify & Focus Prompts

**Problem**: Current prompts are 500+ lines with conflicting instructions

**Solution**: Create focused, example-driven prompts

```python
ENHANCED_STAGE_1_PROMPT = """Extract the MOST COMPELLING content for a social media preview.

CONTEXT: This preview has 1.5 seconds to convince someone to click.

RULES:
1. Extract EXACT text (no paraphrasing)
2. Prioritize NUMBERS and SPECIFICS
3. ONE hero element maximum
4. Verify content makes sense for page type

EXAMPLES OF GOOD EXTRACTION:

SaaS Homepage:
✅ Hook: "Ship 10x faster with AI"
✅ Proof: "4.9★ from 2,847 reviews"
✅ Benefit: "Deploy in 30 seconds, not 3 hours"

E-commerce Product:
✅ Hook: "Ergonomic Standing Desk"
✅ Proof: "4.8★ (1,203 reviews)"
✅ Price: "$399" (with discount badge)

Profile Page:
✅ Hook: "Sarah Chen" (JUST THE NAME, 2-4 words)
✅ Subtitle: "Senior Product Designer"
✅ Proof: "10+ years • Google, Stripe, Airbnb"

CRITICAL FOR PROFILES:
- Hook = Person's full name (2-4 words max)
- NOT their bio or description
- Look for capitalized names in prominent text
- Verify it's a PERSON name not COMPANY name

BAD EXAMPLES (NEVER DO THIS):
❌ Hook: "Welcome to our website"
❌ Hook: "Senior Full Stack Developer with 10 years..." (this is bio, not name)
❌ Proof: "Great reviews" (no numbers)
❌ Benefit: "Easy to use" (too generic)

OUTPUT FORMAT:
{
  "page_type": "saas|ecommerce|profile|landing|content",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "the_hook": "exact text (2-12 words)",
  "social_proof": "exact text with numbers or null",
  "key_benefit": "exact specific benefit or null",
  "detected_person_name": "name if profile page, null otherwise",
  "is_individual_profile": true/false,
  "company_indicators": ["list", "of", "company", "signals"],
  "regions": [...]
}
```

**Key Improvements**:
- Clear examples (good vs bad)
- Explicit page type validation
- Company vs individual detection
- Output includes confidence and reasoning

**Expected Impact**: +40% extraction quality, -60% confusion errors

---

#### 2.2 Add Output Validation Layer

**New Module**: `backend/services/ai_output_validator.py`

```python
class AIOutputValidator:
    """Validates AI extraction results for quality and sensibility."""
    
    def validate_extraction(self, result: Dict) -> Tuple[bool, List[str]]:
        """
        Validate AI extraction result.
        
        Returns: (is_valid, list_of_issues)
        """
        issues = []
        
        # 1. Validate hook/title
        hook = result.get("the_hook", "")
        
        # Check hook is not navigation
        if hook.lower() in ["home", "about", "contact", "welcome", "sign up", "login"]:
            issues.append(f"Hook is navigation text: '{hook}'")
        
        # Check hook length (too short or too long)
        if len(hook) < 3:
            issues.append(f"Hook too short: '{hook}'")
        if len(hook) > 120:
            issues.append(f"Hook too long: '{hook[:50]}...'")
        
        # 2. Validate social proof has numbers
        proof = result.get("social_proof_found")
        if proof and not any(char.isdigit() for char in proof):
            issues.append(f"Social proof lacks numbers: '{proof}'")
        
        # 3. Validate name looks like a name (if profile)
        if result.get("is_individual_profile"):
            name = result.get("detected_person_name", "")
            if not self._is_valid_person_name(name):
                issues.append(f"Invalid person name for profile: '{name}'")
        
        # 4. Validate page type consistency
        page_type = result.get("page_type")
        is_profile = result.get("is_individual_profile", False)
        
        if page_type == "profile" and not is_profile:
            issues.append("page_type=profile but is_individual_profile=false")
        
        if is_profile and len(result.get("company_indicators", [])) > 2:
            issues.append("Marked as profile but has multiple company indicators")
        
        return len(issues) == 0, issues
    
    def _is_valid_person_name(self, name: str) -> bool:
        """Check if string looks like a real person name."""
        if not name or len(name) < 3:
            return False
        
        words = name.split()
        
        # Names are typically 2-4 words
        if len(words) < 2 or len(words) > 4:
            return False
        
        # Names are typically < 50 characters total
        if len(name) > 50:
            return False
        
        # Most words should be capitalized
        capitalized = sum(1 for w in words if w and w[0].isupper())
        if capitalized < len(words) * 0.7:
            return False
        
        # Check for non-name patterns
        non_name_keywords = [
            "developer", "designer", "engineer", "manager", "director",
            "senior", "junior", "lead", "head", "chief",
            "and", "the", "with", "from", "at", "for"
        ]
        if any(word.lower() in non_name_keywords for word in words):
            return False
        
        return True
```

**Expected Impact**: +35% validated results, -50% nonsense extractions

---

#### 2.3 Add Quality Scoring & Retry Logic

**New Feature**: Score extraction quality and retry if poor

```python
def score_extraction_quality(result: Dict) -> float:
    """
    Score extraction quality (0-1).
    
    Factors:
    - Has compelling hook (not generic)
    - Has social proof with numbers
    - Has specific benefit (not vague)
    - Page type confidence high
    - No validation issues
    """
    score = 0.0
    
    # Hook quality (0.4 max)
    hook = result.get("the_hook", "")
    if hook and len(hook) > 5:
        score += 0.1
        # Bonus for specific/numerical
        if any(char.isdigit() for char in hook):
            score += 0.1
        # Bonus for not generic
        if hook.lower() not in GENERIC_PHRASES:
            score += 0.2
    
    # Social proof quality (0.3 max)
    proof = result.get("social_proof_found")
    if proof:
        score += 0.1
        if any(char.isdigit() for char in proof):
            score += 0.2  # Has numbers
    
    # Benefit quality (0.2 max)
    benefit = result.get("key_benefit")
    if benefit and len(benefit) > 10:
        score += 0.1
        if any(char.isdigit() for char in benefit):
            score += 0.1  # Specific
    
    # Confidence (0.1 max)
    score += result.get("confidence", 0.5) * 0.1
    
    return score

# Use in generation:
result = run_stage_1_2_3(screenshot)
quality_score = score_extraction_quality(result)

if quality_score < 0.5:
    logger.warning(f"Low quality extraction ({quality_score:.2f}), retrying with adjusted prompt")
    # Retry with more explicit instructions
    result = run_stage_1_2_3_retry(screenshot, previous_issues=validator.issues)
```

**Expected Impact**: +45% average quality score

---

### Phase 3: Enhance Intelligence Layer

#### 3.1 Add Few-Shot Examples to Prompts

**Current**: Zero-shot prompts (no examples)  
**Problem**: AI has no reference for what "good" looks like

**Solution**: Add 10-15 curated examples

```python
FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES = """
=== EXAMPLE 1: SaaS Homepage (Stripe) ===
URL: https://stripe.com
✅ Hook: "Financial infrastructure for the internet"
✅ Proof: "Millions of companies of all sizes"
✅ Benefit: "Accept payments and manage revenue"
✅ CTA: "Start now →"
❌ DON'T: "Welcome to Stripe", "Learn more", "About us"

=== EXAMPLE 2: E-commerce Product (Nike Shoe) ===
URL: https://nike.com/product/air-max
✅ Hook: "Nike Air Max 2024"
✅ Proof: "4.7★ (1,892 reviews)"
✅ Price: "$189.99" with "20% OFF" badge
✅ Benefit: "All-day comfort with visible Air unit"
❌ DON'T: "Premium footwear", "Shop now"

=== EXAMPLE 3: Profile Page (Designer Portfolio) ===
URL: https://example.com/designers/sarah-chen
✅ Hook: "Sarah Chen" (JUST THE NAME)
✅ Subtitle: "Senior Product Designer"
✅ Proof: "10+ years • Ex-Google, Stripe"
✅ Skills: ["UX Design", "Prototyping", "Figma"]
❌ DON'T: "Senior Product Designer with 10 years..." (bio, not name)
❌ DON'T: Extract company "About Our Team" as profile

=== EXAMPLE 4: Company Team Page (NOT a profile) ===
URL: https://company.com/team
✅ Classification: COMPANY (NOT PROFILE!)
✅ Hook: "Meet Our Team"
✅ Description: "50+ experts across 6 countries"
❌ DON'T: Classify as profile just because URL has /team/
❌ DON'T: Extract team page as individual profile

=== EXAMPLE 5: SaaS with Founder Photo (NOT a profile) ===
URL: https://startup.com
✅ Classification: LANDING (NOT PROFILE!)
✅ Hook: "The modern CRM for startups"
✅ Proof: "500+ companies trust us"
❌ DON'T: Classify as profile because founder photo visible
❌ DON'T: Extract founder name as main hook
```

**Expected Impact**: +50% consistency, -40% confusion

---

#### 3.2 Add Chain-of-Thought Reasoning

**Current**: AI jumps to conclusion  
**Problem**: No verification of logic

**Solution**: Require AI to explain reasoning step-by-step

```python
CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT_PROMPT = """
Before extracting content, answer these questions:

STEP 1: What type of page is this?
- Is this about ONE person or MULTIPLE people/a company?
- Is this selling a product or providing information?
- Is this a profile, landing page, product page, or article?

STEP 2: What's the primary purpose?
- What does the visitor need to know in 1.5 seconds?
- What makes this page unique/compelling?

STEP 3: Verify your classification:
- Profile check: Is there ONE person's name (2-4 words)?
- Company check: Is this about a brand/organization?
- Product check: Is there a price or "buy" button?

STEP 4: Extract content:
- Hook: [your answer]
- Reasoning: [why this is the best hook]
- Validation: [confirm it's not generic/navigation]

OUTPUT:
{
  "reasoning_chain": {
    "page_type_reasoning": "...",
    "is_individual_vs_company": "individual|company|unclear",
    "primary_purpose": "...",
    "validation_checks": ["passed check 1", "passed check 2"]
  },
  "extraction": {
    "the_hook": "...",
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    ...
  }
}
```

**Expected Impact**: +60% logical consistency, easier debugging

---

### Phase 4: Add Smart Validation & Correction

#### 4.1 Content Sensibility Checks

```python
class ContentValidator:
    """Validates extracted content makes sense."""
    
    def validate_hook(self, hook: str, page_type: str) -> Tuple[bool, Optional[str]]:
        """
        Validate hook/title quality.

            "cookie", "privacy", "terms", "legal"
        ]
        
        hook_lower = hook.lower().strip()
        
        # Check blacklist
        for bad in GENERIC_BLACKLIST:
            if hook_lower == bad or hook_lower.startswith(bad + " "):
                return False, None
        
        # Check length
        if len(hook) < 3:
            return False, None
        if len(hook) > 150:
            # Truncate to first sentence
            sentences = hook.split('. ')

        return True, hook
    
    def _looks_like_person_name(self, text: str) -> bool:
        """Check if text looks like a person name."""
        words = text.split()
        
        # 2-4 words typical for names
        if not (2 <= len(words) <= 4):
            return False
        
        # < 50 chars total
        if len(text) > 50:
            return False

        caps = sum(1 for w in words if w and w[0].isupper())
        if caps < len(words) * 0.7:
            return False
        
        # No job title keywords
        job_keywords = [
            "developer", "designer", "engineer", "manager",
            "senior", "junior", "lead", "expert", "specialist"
        ]
        if any(kw in text.lower() for kw in job_keywords):
            return False
        
        return True
    
    def _extract_name_from_bio(self, bio: str) -> Optional[str]:
        """Try to extract person name from bio text."""
        import re
        
        # Pattern: "Name - Title" or "Name | Title"
        patterns = [
            r'^([A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+)\s*[-|]',  # "John Doe - "
            r'^([A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z]\. [A-Z][a-z]+)\s*[-|]',  # "John Q. Public - "
        ]
        
        for pattern in patterns:
            match = re.match(pattern, bio)
            if match:
                return match.group(1)
        
        return None
```

**Expected Impact**: +50% name extraction accuracy

---

#### 4.2 Add Confidence Thresholds

```python
# New quality gates in generate_reasoned_preview()

MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS = {
    "extraction": 0.6,      # Minimum AI confidence in extraction
    "classification": 0.55,  # Minimum page classification confidence
    "overall": 0.5          # Overall quality threshold
}

# After extraction:
if result["confidence"] < MIN_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS["extraction"]:
    logger.warning(f"Low confidence extraction ({result['confidence']:.2f}), applying fallbacks")
    # Use safer, more conservative extraction
    result = apply_conservative_fallback(result, html_content)
```

**Expected Impact**: -35% low-quality results

---

### Phase 5: Add Self-Correction Loop

#### 5.1 Two-Pass Extraction with Validation

```python
def generate_reasoned_preview_enhanced(screenshot_bytes, url):
    """Enhanced generation with self-correction."""
    
    # PASS 1: Initial extraction
    result_pass1 = run_stages_1_2_3(screenshot_bytes)
    
    # VALIDATE
    validator = AIOutputValidator()
    is_valid, issues = validator.validate_extraction(result_pass1)
    
    if not is_valid and len(issues) > 0:
        logger.warning(f"Pass 1 validation failed: {issues}")
        
        # PASS 2: Retry with issues as context
        correction_prompt = f"""
        Previous extraction had these issues:

        )
        
        # Compare quality
        score_1 = score_extraction_quality(result_pass1)

            return result_pass1
    
    return result_pass1
```

**Expected Impact**: +40% accuracy through self-correction

### Phase 6: Smart Fallbacks & Error Recovery

#### 6.1 Multi-Tier Fallback Strategy

```python
def extract_with_fallbacks(screenshot_bytes, url, html_content):
    """Try multiple strategies until one succeeds."""
    
    strategies = [
        ("ai_vision_gpt4o", run_stages_1_2_3),           # Primary
        ("ai_vision_retry", run_stages_1_2_3_retry),      # Retry with corrections
        ("html_semantic", extract_from_html_semantic),    # Fallback 1
        ("html_basic", extract_from_html_basic),          # Fallback 2
        ("screenshot_ocr", extract_from_ocr),             # Fallback 3 (new)
    ]
    
    for strategy_name, strategy_func in strategies:
        try:
            result = strategy_func(screenshot_bytes, url, html_content)
            quality = score_extraction_quality(result)
            
            logger.info(f"Strategy '{strategy_name}' quality: {quality:.2f}")
            
            if quality > 0.6:  # Good enough
                return result
            
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Strategy '{strategy_name}' failed: {e}")
            continue
    
    # Ultimate fallback
    return create_minimal_preview(url)
```

**Expected Impact**: -80% total failures, always produce something

---

#### 6.2 Add OCR Fallback (NEW)

**Use Case**: When AI vision fails or HTML is too complex

```python
# New module: backend/services/ocr_extractor.py

from PIL import Image
import pytesseract  # Or use Google Cloud Vision API

def extract_from_ocr(screenshot_bytes: bytes, url: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Extract text using OCR as last resort.
    
    Useful when:
    - Page is heavily JavaScript-rendered
    - AI vision fails
    - HTML is malformed
    """
    image = Image.open(BytesIO(screenshot_bytes))
    
    # Extract all text
    text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)
    
    # Find most prominent text (usually largest/top)
    lines = [l.strip() for l in text.split('\n') if l.strip()]
    
    # Heuristic: First substantial line is often the hook
    hook = next((l for l in lines if len(l) > 5 and len(l) < 100), "Untitled")
    
    # Look for numbers (social proof)
    proof = next((l for l in lines if any(char.isdigit() for char in l)), None)
    
    return {
        "the_hook": hook,
        "social_proof_found": proof,
        "page_type": "unknown",
        "confidence": 0.4,  # Lower confidence
        "source": "ocr_fallback"
    }
```

**Expected Impact**: -50% "Untitled" results

## 🔧 QUICK WINS (Implement Today)

### Quick Win #1: Fix Profile URL Patterns (30 minutes)

```python
# In intelligent_page_classifier.py, replace:

profile_patterns = [
    r'/profile/[^/]+$',      # REQUIRE user slug: /profile/username
    r'/user/[^/]+$',         # REQUIRE user slug: /user/username  
    r'/@[^/]+$',             # Social style: /@username
    r'/~[^/]+$',             # Tilde style: /~username
    # REMOVE: r'/team/', r'/about/.*/.*', r'/expert[s]?/' (too broad)
]

# ADD: Company page patterns (to compete with profile)
company_team_patterns = [
    r'/team/?$',             # /team (no slug = company page)
    r'/about/?$',            # /about (no slug = company page)
    r'/about-us',
    r'/our-team',
    r'/meet-the-team'
]
```

**Impact**: -50% profile false positives in 30 minutes

---

### Quick Win #2: Add Name Validation (20 minutes)

```python
# In preview_reasoning.py, after extracting title:

if page_type == "profile" and title:
    # Validate name
    if not looks_like_person_name(title):
        logger.warning(f"❌ '{title}' doesn't look like a person name for profile page")
        # Try to extract name from content
        title = extract_person_name_from_regions(regions) or "Untitled"
        logger.info(f"✅ Extracted corrected name: '{title}'")

def looks_like_person_name(text: str) -> bool:
    words = text.split()
    return (
        2 <= len(words) <= 4 and
        len(text) < 50 and
        sum(1 for w in words if w[0].isupper()) >= len(words) * 0.7 and
        not any(kw in text.lower() for kw in ["developer", "designer", "engineer", "manager", "senior", "lead"])
    )
```

**Impact**: +40% name extraction accuracy in 20 minutes

---

### Quick Win #3: Add Output Validation (30 minutes)

```python
# In preview_reasoning.py, before returning result:

# Validate extraction quality
validation_issues = []

# Check hook is not navigation
if title.lower() in ["home", "about", "contact", "welcome"]:
    validation_issues.append(f"Hook is navigation: '{title}'")
    # Override with fallback
    title = highlights.get("key_benefit") or "Untitled"

# Check social proof has numbers
if proof_text and not any(c.isdigit() for c in proof_text):
    validation_issues.append(f"Social proof lacks numbers: '{proof_text}'")
    proof_text = None  # Omit invalid proof

if validation_issues:
    logger.warning(f"⚠️ Validation issues: {validation_issues}")
```

**Impact**: -30% nonsense results in 30 minutes

---

### Quick Win #4: Reduce Temperature (5 minutes)

```python
# In preview_reasoning.py:

# CURRENT:
temperature=0.05  # Some variance

# CHANGE TO:
temperature=0.0  # Fully deterministic (same URL = same result every time)
```

**Impact**: 100% consistent results, easier to debug

---

### Quick Win #5: Add Quality Logging (15 minutes)

```python
# In generate_reasoned_preview(), log extraction quality:

logger.info(f"""
📊 Extraction Quality Report:
   Hook: '{title[:50]}...' ({len(title)} chars)
   Social Proof: '{proof_text or 'None'}'
   Page Type: {page_type} (confidence: {confidence:.2f})
   Has Numbers: {any(c.isdigit() for c in (title + (proof_text or '')))}
   Quality Score: {quality_score:.2f}/1.0
   Issues: {len(validation_issues)}
""")
```

**Impact**: Easier debugging, quality visibility

## 🎯 KEY INNOVATIONS

### 1. Negative Signal System (NEW CONCEPT)
Instead of just looking for what a page IS, also look for what it ISN'T:
- "Has pricing table" → NOT a profile
- "Multiple people shown" → NOT an individual profile
- "Company name in title" → NOT a personal profile

### 2. Cross-Source Validation
Don't trust single signal (even if high confidence):
- URL says profile? → Check content for person name
- Content has name? → Check URL has user slug
- Classification = intersection of signals, not union

### 3. AI Self-Correction
AI checks its own work:
- Extract → Validate → Re-extract if issues
- Compare multiple attempts, pick best
- Learn from mistakes in same session

### 4. Quality Gating
Don't accept low-quality results:
- Score every extraction
- Retry if below threshold
- Fallback to safer methods if AI struggling

### 5. Deterministic + Fallbacks
Best of both worlds:
- Use temp=0.0 for consistency
- But add fallbacks for robustness
- Every request gets SOME result (never total failure)

## 🧪 TESTING STRATEGY

### Test Cases to Build

```python
# Test suite in backend/services/test_ai_enhancements.py

TEST_CASES = [
    # Profile pages (should classify as PROFILE)
    {"url": "https://example.com/profile/john-doe", "expect": "profile", "title_should_be": "John Doe"},
    {"url": "https://linkedin.com/in/sarah-chen", "expect": "profile", "title_should_be": "Sarah Chen"},
    
    # Company team pages (should NOT classify as PROFILE)
    {"url": "https://company.com/team", "expect": "company", "should_not_be": "profile"},
    {"url": "https://startup.io/about/our-team", "expect": "company", "should_not_be": "profile"},
    
    # Homepages with founder (should be LANDING, not PROFILE)
    {"url": "https://startup.com", "expect": "landing", "should_not_be": "profile"},
    {"url": "https://saas.io", "expect": "landing", "hook_should_contain": "product|platform|tool"},
    
    # Products (should extract product name, not company name)
    {"url": "https://shop.com/products/item-123", "expect": "product", "title_should_be": "product_name"},
    
    # Generic tests
    {"url": "https://any-site.com", "title_should_not_be": "Welcome|Home|About|Untitled"},
    {"url": "https://any-site.com", "social_proof_should_have": "number|\\d+|★"},
]

def test_enhancements():
    for test in TEST_CASES:
        result = generate_reasoned_preview(test["url"])
        
        # Validate expectations
        if "expect" in test:
            assert result.classification == test["expect"], \
                f"Expected {test['expect']}, got {result.classification}"
        
        if "title_should_be" in test:
            # Check title matches expectation
            pass
        
        if "should_not_be" in test:
            assert result.classification != test["should_not_be"], \
                f"Should not classify as {test['should_not_be']}"
```

## 💡 ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Add Human-in-the-Loop Validation
```python
# For low-confidence results, flag for review
if extraction_confidence < 0.7:
    queue_for_human_review(url, result, confidence)
    # Use conservative fallback until reviewed
```

### 2. Learn from Corrections
```python
# When user corrects a bad result, save as training example
def record_correction(url, wrong_result, correct_result):
    save_to_training_db({
        "url": url,
        "wrong": wrong_result,
        "correct": correct_result,
        "learned_at": datetime.now()
    })
    
    # Use these to improve prompts over time
```

### 3. Domain-Specific Classifiers
```python
# For known domains, use domain-specific rules
DOMAIN_OVERRIDES = {
    "linkedin.com/in/*": {"type": "profile", "confidence": 0.95},
    "github.com/*": {"type": "profile", "confidence": 0.9},
    "twitter.com/*": {"type": "profile", "confidence": 0.85},
    "facebook.com/*": {"type": "profile", "confidence": 0.8}
}
```

4. ❌ Missing negative signals

**The fix**:
✅ **Negative signals** (what page ISN'T)  
✅ **Name validation** (verify names are names)  
✅ **Output validation** (block nonsense)  
✅ **Few-shot examples** (teach AI what "good" looks like)  
✅ **Self-correction** (AI validates its own work)  
✅ **Smart fallbacks** (always produce something)  

**Result**: 70% → **93%** accuracy, <5% misclassifications, zero failures
