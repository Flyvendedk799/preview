# Prompt for Opus 4.5: Complete Preview Engine Upgrade Analysis

## Context

I have a SaaS application that generates branded URL previews (Open Graph images) for websites. The system uses AI (OpenAI GPT-4o) to analyze website screenshots, extract design DNA (colors, typography, layout patterns, UI components), and generate composited preview images that honor the original site's branding.

**Current Problem:** The generated previews are "not close to good enough" - they lack the quality, sophistication, and brand fidelity needed for a premium SaaS product. The previews feel generic, don't capture the site's unique "vibe", and the branding isn't apparent enough.

## System Architecture

The codebase is a Python FastAPI backend with a React frontend. The core preview generation happens in:

**Main Engine:**
- `backend/services/preview_engine.py` - Core unified preview generation engine (7X enhanced)
- `backend/services/preview_reasoning.py` - Multi-stage AI reasoning framework (6 stages)
- `backend/services/preview_image_generator.py` - Composited image generation
- `backend/services/adaptive_template_engine.py` - Design DNA-aware template rendering

**Design DNA Extraction:**
- `backend/services/design_dna_extractor.py` - Extracts design philosophy, typography, colors, UI components, visual effects, layout patterns
- `backend/services/multi_modal_fusion.py` - Combines HTML, semantic, and AI vision extraction
- `backend/services/brand_extractor.py` - Extracts logos and brand elements

**Quality & Intelligence:**
- `backend/services/quality_orchestrator.py` - Quality gates and validation
- `backend/services/context_aware_extractor.py` - Context-aware content extraction
- `backend/services/content_quality_validator.py` - Content quality validation
- `backend/services/ai_orchestrator.py` - Multi-agent AI coordination
- `backend/services/color_psychology.py` - Color configuration
- `backend/services/typography_intelligence.py` - Typography intelligence

**Supporting Services:**
- `backend/services/playwright_screenshot.py` - Screenshot capture
- `backend/services/r2_client.py` - Image storage (Cloudflare R2)
- `backend/services/preview_cache.py` - Redis caching

## Current Issues (User Feedback)

1. **Lack of Brand "Vibe"**: Previews don't capture the unique branding and feel of the original site
2. **Generic Designs**: All previews look similar, not honoring each site's unique design language
3. **Logo Not Used**: Brand logos aren't being properly extracted and utilized
4. **UI Design Not Extracted**: UI components, visual effects, and layout patterns from the website aren't being captured and applied
5. **Cookie Content**: Cookie notices and GDPR banners are being included in extractions
6. **Text Cutoff**: Sentences are being cut off instead of smart truncation
7. **Quality Issues**: Generated results are scoring poorly on quality gates, leading to fallbacks

## Key Files to Examine

**Start with these core files:**
1. `backend/services/preview_engine.py` - Main orchestration (1831 lines)
2. `backend/services/preview_reasoning.py` - AI reasoning (1965+ lines)
3. `backend/services/design_dna_extractor.py` - Design extraction (963 lines)
4. `backend/services/preview_image_generator.py` - Image generation
5. `backend/services/adaptive_template_engine.py` - Template rendering (1405 lines)
6. `backend/services/multi_modal_fusion.py` - Multi-modal extraction

**Supporting systems:**
- `backend/services/quality_orchestrator.py`
- `backend/services/context_aware_extractor.py`
- `backend/services/brand_extractor.py`
- `backend/api/v1/routes_demo.py` - API endpoint

## Your Mission

**Analyze the entire codebase** and create a **comprehensive upgrade plan** that will transform this into a world-class preview generation system. The goal is to produce previews that:

1. **Honor Brand Identity**: Capture and reflect the unique visual identity of each website
2. **Design Fidelity**: Faithfully reproduce the design language, not generic templates
3. **Sophistication**: Generate premium-quality previews that look professionally designed
4. **Intelligence**: Better understand page context, content hierarchy, and visual importance
5. **Reliability**: Consistently produce high-quality results without fallbacks

## Deliverables Required

Please provide:

### 1. **Architecture Analysis**
   - Current system strengths and weaknesses
   - Bottlenecks in the generation pipeline
   - Areas where AI capabilities aren't being fully utilized
   - Missing components or integrations

### 2. **Quality Gap Analysis**
   - Why previews feel generic vs. brand-specific
   - Why Design DNA extraction isn't translating to better previews
   - Why quality gates are failing
   - Root causes of poor brand fidelity

### 3. **Comprehensive Upgrade Plan**
   - **Phase-by-phase implementation plan** (at least 5-7 phases)
   - **Specific improvements** to each component
   - **New components** that need to be built
   - **AI prompt improvements** and reasoning enhancements
   - **Architecture changes** for better quality
   - **Performance optimizations** (without sacrificing quality)

### 4. **Technical Specifications**
   - Detailed changes to each service
   - New algorithms or approaches
   - Enhanced AI prompts and reasoning chains
   - Better Design DNA utilization strategies
   - Improved image generation techniques

### 5. **Implementation Roadmap**
   - Priority order for changes
   - Dependencies between improvements
   - Estimated complexity/effort for each phase
   - Testing strategy for each phase

## Key Questions to Answer

1. **Why aren't Design DNA extractions translating to better previews?**
   - Is the extraction quality poor?
   - Is the application of DNA to templates insufficient?
   - Are we missing critical design elements?

2. **How can we better leverage GPT-4o's capabilities?**
   - Are we using the right prompts?
   - Should we use more specialized agents?
   - Can we improve the reasoning chain?

3. **What's missing from the current architecture?**
   - Visual analysis improvements?
   - Better content understanding?
   - More sophisticated template generation?

4. **How do we ensure brand fidelity?**
   - Better logo extraction and usage?
   - More accurate color extraction?
   - Better typography matching?
   - UI component replication?

5. **How do we eliminate generic-looking previews?**
   - Template diversity?
   - Better adaptation to source design?
   - More creative composition?

## Constraints & Requirements

- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing API
- Must work with OpenAI GPT-4o (no other AI providers)
- Must generate 1200x630px OG images
- Must handle any website (edge cases, minimal content, etc.)
- Must be production-ready (error handling, logging, monitoring)
- Should improve quality without significantly increasing latency
- Should reduce fallback rate (currently too high)
